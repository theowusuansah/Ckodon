# Send Emails from CSV File

This project includes a straightforward bulk email script that sends the same message to a list of recipients.


## Dependencies

This project only requires the Python standard library
(more specifically, the `csv`, `email`, and `smtplib` modules).


## Running the script

The script requires two configuration files:

* emails.csv contains the email addresses to send the message to.
* credentials.txt contains SMTP server login credentials.
* sending_email.py contains the code.
